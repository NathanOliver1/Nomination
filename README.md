# Nomination

Hi, I'm Nathan Oliver and I would like to become one of your moderators.  Originally I started here to give back to the community as I got plenty of help when I was first learning how to program.  Once I realized that the users, and not just elected moderators, could moderate the site I knew that SO was cut above.  I love that we can make this site better just by taking out the trash and editing borderline questions and answers into good ones.

These days I spend about 50-75% of my time moderating.  I'm pretty active on the C++ tag and I am also a room owner of [SOCVR](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers).  My work with SOCVR over the last couple of years has really helped with my moderation.  I get exposed to so many different things to look at which gives me a good base to apply what I've seen to new stuff coming in.

# Why not me?

* I've never been a moderator on any site before
* I tend to be not very active on the weeks but I am willing to change that
* Not that active on the weekends (But I am willing to log in and run through the mod queues)

# Why me?

* Room owner of a moderation focused chat room
* Moderately active on meta
* Active from 7am to at least 4pm US Central Time
* Help Brad with the hunt for plagiarism
