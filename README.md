# Nomination

Hi, I'm Nathan Oliver. I would like to become one of your moderators. Stack Overflow has always helped me when learning to program. My early interactions with SO consisted of giving back by answering questions. Once I found out that the users, not just elected moderators, could moderate the site, I realized I could give back even more by helping to improve the quality of posts on SO. I love that we can make this site better just by taking out the trash (voting to close/delete) and editing borderline posts into quality submissions.

These days, I spend about 50-75% of my time moderating, focusing on the C++ tag. That consists of a lot of duplicate hunting, close-voting of off-topic questions, and editing questions for formatting and clarity.

I'm a Room Owner of SOCVR, a chat room focused on site moderation. Over the last couple of years, my work with SOCVR has helped me tremendously to become a better site moderator - what to look for, how to handle edge cases, always being responsible to the community for my actions, and more. I get exposed to so many different scenarios to evaluate, which lets me judge new posts faster.

# Why me?

* Room owner of a moderation focused chat room
* Active on meta
* Active on SO from 7am to at least 4pm US Central Time (12pm to 9pm UTC)
* Helped moderators hunt for plagiarism
* 13.8K close votes with 3.5K close vote reviews.
