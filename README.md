# Nomination

Hi, I'm Nathan Oliver and I would like to become one of your moderators. Stack Overflow has always helped me when learning to program, and my early interactions have been giving back by answering questions. Once I realized that the users, and not just elected moderators, could moderate the site I realized that I could do so much more. I love that we can make this site better just by taking out the trash and editing borderline posts into quality submissions.

These days I spend about 50-75% of my time moderating, focusing on the C++ tag. <need 1 more sentence here>

I'm also a Room Owner of SOCVR, a chat room focused on site moderation. My work with the group over the last couple of years has helped me tremendously with becoming a better site moderator - what to look for, how to handle edge cases, when to be responsable for my actions, and more. I get exposed with so many different scenarios to evaluate which lets me judge new posts faster.

# Why me?

* Room owner of a moderation focused chat room
* Moderately active on meta
* Active from 7am to at least 4pm US Central Time
* Help Brad with the hunt for plagiarism
* 13.8K close votes with 3.5K close vote reviews.
